# Diffusion Language Model

Implementation of diffusion models applied to language modeling tasks.

## Overview

This directory contains work-in-progress implementation of diffusion-based approaches to language generation, an alternative to autoregressive language models.

## Files

- `make_datatset.py` - Dataset preparation utilities (in development)
- `pretrain.py` - Pretraining script for diffusion language models (in development)

## Status

This implementation is currently under development. The placeholder files are prepared for implementing diffusion-based text generation.

## Approach

Diffusion language models:
- Apply diffusion processes from image generation to discrete text tokens
- Learn to denoise corrupted text sequences
- Enable non-autoregressive generation
- Provide alternative training objectives to maximum likelihood

## Future Implementation

The complete implementation will include:
- Dataset preprocessing and tokenization
- Forward diffusion process for text corruption
- Reverse diffusion model training
- Sampling and generation procedures
- Evaluation on language modeling benchmarks
