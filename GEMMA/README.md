# GEMMA

Implementation of Google's GEMMA language models, a family of open-source large language models.

## Overview

GEMMA (Google Efficiently Modularized Model Architecture) is a family of lightweight, state-of-the-art open language models built from the same research and technology used to create the Gemini models.

## Files

- `GEMMA1.ipynb` - Initial GEMMA implementation notebook
- `GEMMA2.ipynb` - Extended GEMMA implementation with additional features

## Key Features

GEMMA models are characterized by:
- Open-source weights and architecture
- Efficient design for various deployment scenarios
- Strong performance relative to model size
- Built on Transformer architecture with modern improvements
- Available in multiple sizes (2B, 7B parameters)

## Model Characteristics

- Decoder-only Transformer architecture
- Multi-Query Attention (MQA) for efficiency
- RoPE (Rotary Position Embeddings)
- GeGLU activations in feed-forward layers
- RMSNorm for layer normalization
- SentencePiece tokenization

## Applications

- Text generation and completion
- Question answering
- Instruction following
- Code generation
- Conversational AI
- Fine-tuning for downstream tasks

## Implementation Notes

The notebooks explore different aspects of the GEMMA architecture and may include:
- Model initialization and loading
- Inference examples
- Fine-tuning procedures
- Performance evaluation
