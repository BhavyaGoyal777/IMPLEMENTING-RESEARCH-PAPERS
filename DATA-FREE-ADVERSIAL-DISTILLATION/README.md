# Data-Free Adversarial Distillation (DFAD)

Implementation of Data-Free Adversarial Distillation for knowledge transfer from a teacher network to a student network without access to the original training data.

## Overview

This implementation demonstrates knowledge distillation in a data-free setting, where a student model learns from a teacher model using adversarially generated synthetic data instead of the original training dataset.

## Key Concepts

Data-Free Adversarial Distillation enables:
- Knowledge transfer without requiring the original training data
- Student network training using synthetic samples generated by an adversarial generator
- Preservation of teacher model performance while reducing model size
- Privacy-preserving model compression

## Approach

The typical DFAD framework consists of:
1. A pre-trained teacher network (fixed)
2. A student network (to be trained)
3. A generator network that creates synthetic training data
4. Adversarial training where the generator learns to create samples that maximize disagreement between teacher and student predictions
5. Knowledge distillation where the student learns to mimic the teacher's outputs

## Use Cases

- Model compression when original training data is unavailable
- Privacy-sensitive applications where data cannot be shared
- Transfer learning in restricted data environments
- Efficient deployment of large models
