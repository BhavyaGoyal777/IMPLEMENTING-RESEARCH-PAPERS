# LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation

Implementation of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for large pre-trained models.

## Overview

LoRA is a technique that dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters for fine-tuning large language models by freezing the pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable low-rank decomposition matrices into each layer.

## Key Concepts

### How LoRA Works

Instead of fine-tuning all parameters, LoRA:
1. Freezes the pre-trained model weights W
2. Adds trainable low-rank matrices A and B where W' = W + BA
3. Only trains A and B during fine-tuning
4. Significantly reduces memory and compute requirements

### Mathematical Formulation

For a weight matrix W of size d × d:
- Original update: W' = W + ΔW (requires d² parameters)
- LoRA update: W' = W + BA where B is d × r and A is r × d
- Trainable parameters: 2dr (where r << d)

## Advantages

### Efficiency
- Reduces trainable parameters by 10,000x or more
- Reduces GPU memory requirements by 3x
- No additional inference latency after merging weights
- Faster training times

### Flexibility
- Multiple task-specific adapters can share the same base model
- Easy to switch between different fine-tuned versions
- Modular approach to model adaptation
- Lower storage costs for multiple adaptations

### Performance
- Matches or exceeds full fine-tuning quality
- Better performance than other adapter methods
- No degradation in inference speed
- Maintains model generalization

## Hyperparameters

### Rank (r)
- Controls the dimensionality of low-rank matrices
- Typical values: 4, 8, 16, 32
- Lower rank = fewer parameters, faster training
- Higher rank = more expressiveness, better performance

### Alpha (α)
- Scaling factor for LoRA updates
- Often set to 2r or r
- Controls the magnitude of adaptations

### Target Modules
- Usually applied to query and value projection matrices
- Can be extended to all linear layers
- Module selection affects performance and efficiency

## Applications

- Fine-tuning large language models on specific tasks
- Domain adaptation with limited compute
- Multi-task learning with shared base models
- Personalization and customization
- Research and experimentation with large models

## Comparison with Other Methods

### vs Full Fine-Tuning
- LoRA: Far fewer parameters, lower memory, comparable performance
- Full Fine-Tuning: All parameters updated, high memory cost

### vs Adapter Layers
- LoRA: No additional inference latency
- Adapters: Additional sequential computation at inference

### vs Prompt Tuning
- LoRA: More flexible, better performance on complex tasks
- Prompt Tuning: Even fewer parameters, limited expressiveness

## Use Cases

- Fine-tuning LLMs on custom datasets
- Creating task-specific models from a shared base
- Resource-constrained environments
- Rapid experimentation and iteration
- Production deployment with multiple model variants
