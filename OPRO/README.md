# OPRO - Optimization by PROmpting

Implementation of OPRO (Optimization by PROmpting), a technique that uses large language models as optimizers to improve prompts and solutions through iterative refinement.

## Overview

OPRO leverages the natural language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs to optimize prompts and task solutions. Instead of manual prompt engineering, the LLM proposes and refines prompts based on performance feedback.

## Key Concepts

### How OPRO Works

1. **Initialization**: Start with an initial prompt or solution
2. **Evaluation**: Test the prompt on a set of examples
3. **Feedback**: Collect performance metrics and error analysis
4. **Optimization**: LLM generates improved prompts based on feedback
5. **Iteration**: Repeat until convergence or maximum iterations

### Core Components

#### Meta-Prompt
- Instructs the LLM to act as an optimizer
- Describes the optimization task
- Provides format for generating new prompts
- Includes historical performance data

#### Optimization Loop
