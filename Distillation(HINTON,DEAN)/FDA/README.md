# Feature Distillation and Advanced Techniques

Advanced implementations related to knowledge distillation, including vision-language models and feature projection techniques.

## Overview

This directory contains advanced distillation techniques and multimodal model implementations that extend beyond basic knowledge distillation.

## Files

- `siglip.ipynb` - Implementation of SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss for Language-Image Pre-training), a vision-language model
- `projector.ipynb` - Feature projection module for aligning different modality representations
- `roadmap.md` - Comprehensive technical roadmap for data-free adversarial knowledge distillation on CIFAR-100

## Key Components

### SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss for Language-Image Pre-training)
- Vision-language model using sigmoid loss instead of softmax
- Enables efficient image-text matching
- More stable training compared to contrastive approaches

### Projector Module
- Bridges representations between different modalities or model layers
- Aligns feature spaces for effective knowledge transfer
- Critical component in multimodal learning

### Technical Roadmap
The roadmap.md file provides detailed implementation guidelines for:
- Data-free adversarial distillation on CIFAR-100
- Student model architectures (10% and 20% of teacher parameters)
- Generator network design
- Training procedures and optimization strategies

## Use Cases

- Vision-language model training
- Multimodal knowledge distillation
- Feature alignment across different architectures
- Efficient model compression for multimodal tasks

## Relation to Parent Directory

While the parent directory focuses on classical knowledge distillation (Hinton & Dean), this subdirectory explores:
- Modern multimodal applications
- Advanced feature-level distillation
- Data-free distillation techniques
- Vision-language model implementations
