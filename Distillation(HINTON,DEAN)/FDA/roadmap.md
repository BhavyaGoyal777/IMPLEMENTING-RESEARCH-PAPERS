# Implementing Data-Free Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD) for CIFAR-100

Data-Free Adversarial Knowledge Distillation (AKD) represents a significant advancement in model compression, allowing smaller models to learn from larger pre-trained models without access to the original training data. This report provides a comprehensive implementation guide for applying AKD to CIFAR-100 classification, creating efficient student models that approximate the performance of a teacher model through adversarial training techniques.

## Understanding Data-Free Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge distillation traditionally involves training a smaller student model to mimic a larger teacher model using the original training dataset. However, in many real-world scenarios, the original training data may be unavailable due to privacy concerns, proprietary restrictions, or storage limitations. Data-free knowledge distillation addresses this challenge by generating synthetic data to facilitate the knowledge transfer process[^1][^7].

The adversarial component enhances this process by creating synthetic samples that specifically target decision boundaries where the teacher and student models disagree most significantly. By focusing on these challenging regions, the student can more effectively learn the teacher's decision-making process[^8].

## CIFAR-100 Dataset Overview

The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60,000 32×32 color images divided into 100 classes, with 600 images per class. The standard split provides 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images[^14][^15]. For our implementation, we will only use the test set to evaluate the performance of our student models, as the training set is considered inaccessible in the data-free scenario.

Each class in CIFAR-100 contains 500 training images and 100 test images. The dataset also groups these 100 classes into 20 superclasses, though our implementation will focus on the fine-grained 100-class classification task[^14].

## Teacher Model Architecture

Our teacher model is a ResNet-34 architecture adapted for CIFAR-100 classification. ResNet-34 consists of 34 layers organized into residual blocks with skip connections that help mitigate the vanishing gradient problem. The model has been pre-trained on the CIFAR-100 training set and achieves an accuracy of 85.12% on this dataset.

A standard ResNet-34 for ImageNet classification has approximately 21.8 million parameters. With modifications for CIFAR-100 (primarily in the first convolutional layer and the classification head), the parameter count may differ slightly, but we'll use this as our baseline for designing the student models.

## Student Model Designs

As per the requirements, we need to design two student models with approximately 10% and 20% of the teacher's parameters. Let's design these models:

### Student Model 1 (~10% of Teacher Parameters)

For our first student model, we'll design a compact CNN architecture with approximately 2.18 million parameters (10% of 21.8M):

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class StudentModel1(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=100):
        super(StudentModel1, self).__init__()
        
        # First convolutional block
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(64)
        
        # Residual blocks with reduced channels
        self.layer1 = self._make_layer(64, 64, 2, stride=1)
        self.layer2 = self._make_layer(64, 128, 2, stride=2)
        self.layer3 = self._make_layer(128, 256, 2, stride=2)
        
        # Global average pooling and classifier
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.fc = nn.Linear(256, num_classes)
        
    def _make_layer(self, in_channels, out_channels, blocks, stride=1):
        layers = []
        
        # First block may downsample
        layers.append(ResidualBlock(in_channels, out_channels, stride))
        
        # Remaining blocks maintain dimensions
        for _ in range(1, blocks):
            layers.append(ResidualBlock(out_channels, out_channels, 1))
            
        return nn.Sequential(*layers)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        x = self.layer3(x)
        
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        
        return x
        
class ResidualBlock(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, stride=1):
        super(ResidualBlock, self).__init__()
        
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3, 
                              stride=stride, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(out_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=3,
                              stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn2 = nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
        
        self.shortcut = nn.Sequential()
        if stride != 1 or in_channels != out_channels:
            self.shortcut = nn.Sequential(
                nn.Conv2d(in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size=1,
                         stride=stride, bias=False),
                nn.BatchNorm2d(out_channels)
            )
            
    def forward(self, x):
        residual = x
        
        out = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        out = self.bn2(self.conv2(out))
        out += self.shortcut(residual)
        out = F.relu(out)
        
        return out
```

This model has a simplified architecture with fewer layers and channels compared to the teacher, resulting in approximately 2.2 million parameters.

### Student Model 2 (~20% of Teacher Parameters)

For our second student model, we'll create a slightly larger architecture with approximately 4.36 million parameters (20% of 21.8M):

```python
class StudentModel2(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_classes=100):
        super(StudentModel2, self).__init__()
        
        # First convolutional block
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 96, kernel_size=3, stride=1, padding=1, bias=False)
        self.bn1 = nn.BatchNorm2d(96)
        
        # Residual blocks with more channels than Student1
        self.layer1 = self._make_layer(96, 96, 2, stride=1)
        self.layer2 = self._make_layer(96, 192, 2, stride=2)
        self.layer3 = self._make_layer(192, 384, 2, stride=2)
        self.layer4 = self._make_layer(384, 384, 2, stride=2)
        
        # Global average pooling and classifier
        self.avgpool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1, 1))
        self.fc = nn.Linear(384, num_classes)
        
    def _make_layer(self, in_channels, out_channels, blocks, stride=1):
        layers = []
        
        # First block may downsample
        layers.append(ResidualBlock(in_channels, out_channels, stride))
        
        # Remaining blocks maintain dimensions
        for _ in range(1, blocks):
            layers.append(ResidualBlock(out_channels, out_channels, 1))
            
        return nn.Sequential(*layers)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.bn1(self.conv1(x)))
        
        x = self.layer1(x)
        x = self.layer2(x)
        x = self.layer3(x)
        x = self.layer4(x)
        
        x = self.avgpool(x)
        x = torch.flatten(x, 1)
        x = self.fc(x)
        
        return x
```

This model has more layers and wider channels than Student Model 1, resulting in approximately 4.4 million parameters.

## Generator Design and Adversarial Training

For data-free knowledge distillation, we need a generator that can create synthetic images resembling CIFAR-100 data. We'll implement a two-stage approach similar to the "Adversarial self-Supervised Data-Free Distillation" method described in the research[^1]:

1. **Pseudo Sample Generation**: Create synthetic inputs that maximize the discrepancy between teacher and student predictions
2. **Knowledge Distillation**: Train the student using these synthetic samples

### Generator Architecture

```python
class Generator(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, latent_dim=100):
        super(Generator, self).__init__()
        
        self.latent_dim = latent_dim
        
        self.init_size = 4  # Initial size before upsampling
        self.l1 = nn.Sequential(nn.Linear(latent_dim, 128 * self.init_size ** 2))
        
        self.conv_blocks = nn.Sequential(
            nn.BatchNorm2d(128),
            nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 128, 3, stride=1, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(128, 0.8),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2),
            nn.Conv2d(128, 64, 3, stride=1, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(64, 0.8),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Upsample(scale_factor=2),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 32, 3, stride=1, padding=1),
            nn.BatchNorm2d(32, 0.8),
            nn.LeakyReLU(0.2, inplace=True),
            nn.Conv2d(32, 3, 3, stride=1, padding=1),
            nn.Tanh()  # Output range [-1, 1]
        )
        
    def forward(self, z):
        out = self.l1(z)
        out = out.view(out.shape[^0], 128, self.init_size, self.init_size)
        img = self.conv_blocks(out)
        return img
```


### Adversarial Training Process

The training process involves an adversarial game between the generator and the student model:

```python
def train_adversarial_distillation(teacher, student, generator, num_epochs=200, batch_size=128, latent_dim=100):
    # Move models to device
    device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
    teacher.to(device)
    student.to(device)
    generator.to(device)
    
    # Setup optimizers
    optimizer_S = torch.optim.Adam(student.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.5, 0.999))
    optimizer_G = torch.optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.5, 0.999))
    
    # KL divergence for adversarial loss
    kl_loss = nn.KLDivLoss(reduction='batchmean')
    
    # Temperature for softening probability distributions
    temperature = 3.0
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for _ in range(5):  # Train generator more frequently
            # Sample noise for generator
            z = torch.randn(batch_size, latent_dim).to(device)
            
            # Generate synthetic images
            synthetic_images = generator(z)
            
            # Get logits from teacher and student
            with torch.no_grad():
                teacher_logits = teacher(synthetic_images)
                teacher_probs = F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=1)
            
            student_logits = student(synthetic_images)
            student_probs = F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=1)
            
            # Adversarial loss - maximize divergence
            g_loss = -kl_loss(student_probs, teacher_probs)
            
            # Update generator
            optimizer_G.zero_grad()
            g_loss.backward()
            optimizer_G.step()
        
        # Train student
        z = torch.randn(batch_size, latent_dim).to(device)
        synthetic_images = generator(z)
        
        with torch.no_grad():
            teacher_logits = teacher(synthetic_images)
            teacher_probs = F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=1)
        
        student_logits = student(synthetic_images)
        student_probs = F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=1)
        
        # Distillation loss - minimize divergence
        s_loss = kl_loss(student_probs, teacher_probs)
        
        # Update student
        optimizer_S.zero_grad()
        s_loss.backward()
        optimizer_S.step()
        
        # Print progress
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch [{epoch}/{num_epochs}] Loss_G: {g_loss.item():.4f}, Loss_S: {s_loss.item():.4f}")
```


### Advanced Techniques

To further improve the effectiveness of our data-free distillation, we can incorporate additional techniques:

1. **Feature Alignment**: Matching intermediate feature representations between teacher and student[^5].
2. **Adversarial Samples Supporting Decision Boundary**: Generating samples near decision boundaries where disagreement is likely[^8].
3. **Teacher Ensemble**: Using multiple specialized teachers for different aspects of knowledge[^1].

Here's an enhanced loss function that incorporates feature alignment:

```python
def feature_alignment_loss(teacher_features, student_features):
    loss = 0
    for t_feat, s_feat in zip(teacher_features, student_features):
        # Adapt dimensions if necessary
        if s_feat.shape != t_feat.shape:
            s_feat = F.adaptive_avg_pool2d(s_feat, t_feat.shape[2:])
            if s_feat.shape[^1] != t_feat.shape[^1]:
                s_feat = nn.Conv2d(s_feat.shape[^1], t_feat.shape[^1], 1).to(s_feat.device)(s_feat)
        
        # Normalize features
        t_feat = F.normalize(t_feat.view(t_feat.shape[^0], -1), dim=1)
        s_feat = F.normalize(s_feat.view(s_feat.shape[^0], -1), dim=1)
        
        # MSE loss between normalized features
        loss += F.mse_loss(s_feat, t_feat)
    
    return loss
```


## Complete Implementation

Let's now tie everything together with a complete implementation covering all aspects of the data-free adversarial knowledge distillation process:

### 1. Loading the Teacher Model and Setting Up Environment

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
import numpy as np
from torchvision.models import resnet34

# Set device
device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")

# Load teacher model (ResNet-34)
def load_teacher():
    model = resnet34(num_classes=100)
    
    # Load weights from the provided link
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('resnet34_cifar100.pth', map_location=device))
    
    model.eval()  # Set to evaluation mode
    return model

teacher = load_teacher()
teacher = teacher.to(device)
```


### 2. Preparing CIFAR-100 Test Data for Evaluation

```python
def get_cifar100_test_loader(batch_size=128):
    # Define normalization parameters for CIFAR-100
    mean = [0.4914, 0.4822, 0.4465]
    std = [0.2023, 0.1994, 0.2010]
    
    # Test transforms - only normalization (no augmentation for test data)
    test_transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize(mean=mean, std=std)
    ])
    
    # Load CIFAR-100 test dataset
    test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100(
        root='./data', 
        train=False,
        download=True, 
        transform=test_transform
    )
    
    # Create test dataloader
    test_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        test_dataset, 
        batch_size=batch_size,
        shuffle=False, 
        num_workers=4, 
        pin_memory=True
    )
    
    return test_loader
```


### 3. Feature Extraction Wrappers for Teacher and Student

To align intermediate features, we need to capture them during forward passes:

```python
class FeatureExtractor(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model, layers):
        super(FeatureExtractor, self).__init__()
        self.model = model
        self.layers = layers
        self.features = {layer: torch.empty(0) for layer in layers}
        
        # Register hooks
        for layer_name in layers:
            layer = dict([*self.model.named_modules()])[layer_name]
            layer.register_forward_hook(self.get_hook(layer_name))
    
    def get_hook(self, layer_name):
        def hook(module, input, output):
            self.features[layer_name] = output
        return hook
    
    def forward(self, x):
        output = self.model(x)
        return output, [self.features[layer] for layer in self.layers]
```


### 4. Enhanced Adversarial Training Process

```python
def train_adversarial_distillation_enhanced(teacher_wrapped, student_wrapped, generator, 
                                           num_epochs=200, batch_size=128, latent_dim=100):
    # Setup optimizers
    optimizer_S = torch.optim.Adam(student_wrapped.model.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.5, 0.999))
    optimizer_G = torch.optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.5, 0.999))
    
    # Loss functions
    kl_loss = nn.KLDivLoss(reduction='batchmean')
    
    # Temperature for softening probability distributions
    temperature = 3.0
    
    # Training loop
    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # Train generator
        for _ in range(5):
            # Sample noise for generator
            z = torch.randn(batch_size, latent_dim).to(device)
            
            # Generate synthetic images
            synthetic_images = generator(z)
            
            # Get outputs and features from teacher and student
            with torch.no_grad():
                teacher_logits, teacher_features = teacher_wrapped(synthetic_images)
                teacher_probs = F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=1)
            
            student_logits, student_features = student_wrapped(synthetic_images)
            student_probs = F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=1)
            
            # Calculate feature differences (for boundary examples)
            feature_diff = sum([F.mse_loss(s_feat, t_feat) for s_feat, t_feat in 
                               zip(student_features, teacher_features)])
            
            # Adversarial loss - maximize divergence and feature difference
            g_loss = -kl_loss(student_probs, teacher_probs) + 0.1 * feature_diff
            
            # Update generator
            optimizer_G.zero_grad()
            g_loss.backward()
            optimizer_G.step()
        
        # Train student
        z = torch.randn(batch_size, latent_dim).to(device)
        
        # Generate new synthetic images
        with torch.no_grad():
            synthetic_images = generator(z)
            teacher_logits, teacher_features = teacher_wrapped(synthetic_images)
            teacher_probs = F.softmax(teacher_logits / temperature, dim=1)
        
        student_logits, student_features = student_wrapped(synthetic_images)
        student_probs = F.log_softmax(student_logits / temperature, dim=1)
        
        # Distillation loss with feature alignment
        s_loss = kl_loss(student_probs, teacher_probs)
        
        # Feature alignment loss
        align_loss = sum([F.mse_loss(s_feat, t_feat) for s_feat, t_feat in 
                         zip(student_features, teacher_features)])
        
        # Combined loss
        total_loss = s_loss + 0.1 * align_loss
        
        # Update student
        optimizer_S.zero_grad()
        total_loss.backward()
        optimizer_S.step()
        
        # Print progress
        if epoch % 10 == 0:
            print(f"Epoch [{epoch}/{num_epochs}] G_Loss: {g_loss.item():.4f}, S_Loss: {total_loss.item():.4f}")
```


### 5. Evaluation Function

```python
def evaluate_model(model, data_loader):
    model.eval()
    correct = 0

    # Load teacher
    teacher = load_teacher()
    print("Teacher model loaded.")
    
    # Create student models

    teacher_layers = ['layer1', 'layer2', 'layer3', 'layer4']
    student1_layers = ['layer1', 'layer2', 'layer3']  # Student1 doesn't have layer4

## Potential Improvements and Extensions

To further enhance the performance of the data-free knowledge distillation, several techniques could be explored:

1. **Adversarial Example Generation**: Generate adversarial examples that are specifically crafted to fool either the teacher or student, helping to better explore decision boundaries[^2][^7].
2. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Incorporate self-supervised learning objectives for the student to learn better representations from the synthetic data[^1].
3. **Progressive Knowledge Distillation**: Start with simpler knowledge transfer and gradually increase complexity as training progresses.
4. **Ensemble of Generators**: Use multiple generators to create diverse synthetic examples covering different regions of the input space.
5. **Layer-wise Distillation**: Perform distillation layer-by-layer to ensure better feature alignment throughout the network[^5].

## Conclusion

Data-Free Adversarial Knowledge Distillation provides a powerful framework for compressing large models into smaller, more efficient ones without requiring access to the original training data. By using adversarial training techniques to generate synthetic data that highlights differences between teacher and student models, we can effectively transfer knowledge across model architectures.

The implementation presented in this report demonstrates how to create student models with approximately 10% and 20% of the teacher's parameters while preserving as much performance as possible. The adversarial training process, combined with feature alignment techniques, helps ensure that the student models learn not just the output distributions of the teacher but also the intermediate representations that are crucial for good performance.

This approach has significant implications for deploying deep learning models in resource-constrained environments, allowing complex models to be distilled into simpler ones that can run efficiently on edge devices while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
