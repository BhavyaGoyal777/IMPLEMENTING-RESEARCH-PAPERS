# VLM - Vision Language Models

Implementation of Vision Language Models (VLMs) that combine visual and textual understanding for multimodal AI tasks.

## Overview

Vision Language Models integrate computer vision and natural language processing to understand and generate content that involves both images and text. This directory focuses on modern VLM architectures and their key components.

## Key Components

### SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss for Language-Image Pre-training)

SigLIP is an improved vision-language pre-training approach that uses sigmoid loss instead of the traditional softmax-based contrastive loss (as in CLIP).

#### Advantages of SigLIP
- **Improved Efficiency**: Sigmoid loss allows for more efficient batch processing
- **Better Scaling**: More stable training at larger batch sizes
- **Pairwise Learning**: Treats each image-text pair independently
- **Reduced Memory**: Lower memory requirements compared to CLIP
- **Better Performance**: Often achieves superior results on downstream tasks

#### Architecture
- Vision Encoder: Processes images into visual representations
- Text Encoder: Processes text into textual embeddings
- Projection Layers: Align visual and textual feature spaces
- Sigmoid-based Matching: Computes similarity scores using sigmoid activation

### Projector Module

The projector is a crucial component that bridges the gap between vision and language modalities.

#### Purpose
- Aligns visual features from vision encoder with language model embedding space
- Enables the language model to "understand" visual information
- Projects high-dimensional visual features to language model dimensions

#### Common Architectures
- **Linear Projection**: Simple learned linear transformation
- **MLP Projector**: Multi-layer perceptron for non-linear mapping
- **Cross-Attention**: Attention-based alignment mechanism
- **Resampler**: Reduces number of visual tokens while preserving information

#### Design Considerations
- Input dimension: Vision encoder output size
- Output dimension: Language model embedding size
- Number of layers: Balance between capacity and efficiency
- Activation functions: GeLU, ReLU, or other non-linearities

## Vision Language Model Pipeline

### Training Process

1. **Vision Encoding**: Extract features from images using vision transformer or CNN
2. **Text Encoding**: Process text through language model tokenizer and embeddings
3. **Feature Projection**: Align visual features to language space via projector
4. **Contrastive Learning**: Train to match corresponding image-text pairs
5. **Fine-tuning**: Adapt to specific downstream tasks

### Inference Process

1. **Image Input**: Process image through vision encoder
2. **Feature Projection**: Project visual features to language space
3. **Multimodal Fusion**: Combine visual and textual information
4. **Generation/Classification**: Produce output based on task
